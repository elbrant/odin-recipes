	<h1>Fannie Mae's Potato Salad</h1>
	<h4>Description</h4>
	<p>A family recipe passed down from Mother to Daughter for generations.  This could be it's premier debut to anyone outside of the family! :)</p>
	<h4>Ingredients</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Russet Potatoes, bite sized cubes</li>
		<li>Hard boiled eggs, peeled and chopped</li>
		<li>Onion, diced</li>
		<li>Green Pepper, diced</li>
		<li>Sweet Pickle Relish</li>
		<li>Mayonaisse</li>
		<li>1tsp Celery Seed</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Steps</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Cover diced potatoes with water. Drop in one egg for each average sized potato. Bring to a simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
		<li>Use this time to dice the Onion and Green Pepper. Fill a bowl with ice water and set aside.</li>
		<li>At the 10 minute mark, carefully remove the eggs and place them in the ice water for a rapid cool down. The potatoes should simmer for another 10 minutes, or until they are fork tender. When they are done, turn the heat off, but allow them to rest in the hot water.</li>
		<li>When the eggs are cool enough to handle, peel and rinse them, then place them in a large bowl. Chop the eggs. Add diced onion and bell pepper, a couple heaping spoonfuls of Relish, and the Celery seed.</li>
		<li>Drain the potatoes, add them to the chopped egg mixutre. Dollop about a quarter cup of Mayo into the bowl and stir to combine and coat the potatoes. Add more Mayo if needed.</li>
		<li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
		<li>Allow to cool. Refrigerate before serving, if possible.</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Notes</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>This is another recipe that can be adjusted depending on the number of servings needed. Allow 1 med-large potato/egg for each serving.</li>
		<li>Do not drain the potatoes until you are ready to mix it all together. Hot potatoes absorb the Mayonaisse.</li>
		<li>This Potato Salad is best served at room temp or chilled. </li>
	</ul>
