	<p>Sweet and Spicy, these are not canned beans! The subtle blend of jelly and peppers can be upped to your liking by adding additional peppers. Serve it as a side, or get a bigger bowl for a meal size serving.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Saute the meat in oil, browning on all sides and seasoning with the salt, pepper and garlic powder.</li>
		<li>Add chopped onion and jalapenos, stirring to gather fond from the bottom of the pan.</li>
		<li>Canned beans:<br>   Add (undrained) beans.</li>
		<li>Dried beans:<br>   Rinse 1C (half of a 1# bag), plucking out errant pebbles and odd beans. Drain, add 3 C water and the beans to the pan. Bring to a boil before lowering heat. Covered with a slightly tilted lid to allow steam to escape. Simmer 45 minutes.</li>
		<li>Stir in the Steak Sauce and Jalapeno Jelly.</li>
		<li>Simmer until the (dried) beans are soft and the liquids have reduced to a sauce.</li>
	</ol>

	<ul>
		<li>Look for a Goldilocks sauce. You don't want it soupy, and you don't want to forget and let it scorch.</li>
		<li>You will find (boneless) Country Ribs in the Pork section. You could substitute Boston Butt, but it will take longer for the meat to cook.</li>
